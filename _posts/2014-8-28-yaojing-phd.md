很久了，我一直希望自己能快点毕业，工作。但是，由于自己十分拖拉，懒散，不专注在研究上，一直没有成果，自己对科研失去了当初的兴趣，甚至博士毕业也成了头疼的难题。究其原因，就是自己不够自律。

我想工作，殊不知，研究生阶段的学习本身就是一份工作，是一份对自身要求更高，“薪水低”的工作。多么遗憾，研究生6年过去了，我一无所获，却养成了懒散拖拉的坏习惯。因为懒散拖拉，导致迟迟没有成果，心情也一直不好，直接影响毕业和找工作，进入恶性循环。

解决问题，在我自己，因为问题在自己。矛盾出于内在。


晚上看了姚静老师的博客[书尧成长记录的博客](blog.sina.com.cn/shuyao730)。

每次比较仔细地阅读她的博客，我都备受鼓舞。

姚静老师80年出生，南大本硕毕业，在河海工作了几年，2009年8月去ASU读博士。2013年1月毕业。

很佩服她。

现在在英国一个非常漂亮的学校，圣安德鲁斯大学博士后，带着6岁的女儿。

他们一家三口，真的好幸福。

我未曾见过姚静老师和小书，只从她的博客上看到过她们的照片；在水文院的一次会议上，见过张老师，很年轻，看起来很有魅力。

有追求，有规划，有魄力，有毅力。独立的女性，伟大的女性。

这也是我向往的生活。

下面是美国工程院院士 B. E. Rittman撰写的“如何成为一名成功的博士生”，引自[Some Thoughts on Being a (Successful) Ph.D. student](http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_6145e3890100fmoy.html)

1. With respect to your research, by the end of your time as a Ph.D. student, you should be the world's foremost expert on your specialized topic. No one else will know as much as you do about your topic.等到你博士毕业的时候，你应该是你所研究领域的世界级顶级专家。没有任何其他人比你对自己的领域知道的更多。
2. You must read widely, voraciously, and critically. Reading widely means reading books and journals in fields other than those of typical of Environmental Engineering. **Reading voraciously means reading many papers and books and doing so regularly.** A good rule of thumb is an average of one paper per day. **Reading critically means spending the time and intellectual energy to fully understand the paper, to appreciate how it can have impact on your work and career, and to discover its weakness, as well as its strengths.** A good approach is to summarize, in your own words and symbols, the key findings and concepts of each paper that is of suitable quality and interest. 进行广泛而贪婪，并带有批判性地阅读。贪婪地阅读是说定期阅读大量的论文和书籍。一个值得称赞的方法是平均每天阅读一篇文献。批判性阅读是指花时间和思考来完全读懂论文，分析如何将其运用到自己的研究和工作中，并发现论文的优点和缺点。一个很好的方法就是用自己的语言来总结论文的主要发现和概念。

**Reading is the foundation upon which your work and career are built.** It allows you to catch up on the years or decades of previous work and broadens your understanding of research. Reading helps you become an up-to-date expert. Reading also lets you learn the means and standards for professional publication.

Reading provides the seeds that will yield the new research concepts, plans and interpretations required if you are to make contributions at a high level. Once you are out of school, you will have less time and access for voractious reading. Now is the time to read, read, read!

3. **To obtain the maximum benefits from your work, frequently present your work in written and oral form.** Such presentations force you to organize your thoughts and to seperate the peripheral material from the critical material. It forces you to connect ideas and to discover inconsistencies in your thinking. If you have some really interesting and substantial results, consider preparing a paper for a journal or a conference. 经常性地将自己的研究成果以书面或口头形式展示出来，以从工作中获得最大收益。

**Remember that your long-term success and professional impact are determined by your ability to present yourself and your work effectively.** 记住，你的长久成功及专业影响力是由能有效地展示自己及工作的能力决定的。

5. Have only the highest standdards for yourself and your work. In other words, be your own toughest critic. Demand deeper understanding, better communication, and more accuracy of yourself than will be demanded by your professors. Try to find your errors before they are pointed out by others. When you detect errors, be free to admit them, because then you can learn from them.
6. Observe those around you, especially those who are recognized as being successful. Try to take on the best qualities and fit them into your personality. However, remember that you are unique and cannot be a copy of anyone else.
7. Share your thoughts, ideas, and knowledge. Your student and faculty colleges here are your greatest resouce of experience, support, and encouragement- now and far into the future.
8. Enjoy the relative freedom of being a graduate student. Use this valuable time to explore new directions and to get to know new and different people.
9. Remember that the** ultimate goal of a graduate student is to stop being a graduate student,mamely, to finish.** The best way to go directly toward this ultimate goal is to **approach all your work in a professional and business-like manner. Graduate study is a job that requires self-discipline.研究生阶段的学习是一份需要自律的工作。 ** 将所有的工作都以一种专业和商业的方式组织起来。研究生阶段的学习是一份需要自律的工作。

一个研究生的最终目标是停止做一个研究生，也就是要完成它。
