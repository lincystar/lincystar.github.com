I was woke up at 3:00 at the early night, by a dream.

This is the third time in this month, woke up with the similar dreams.

I got up and sit in front of the table, turned on my laptop, and started working.

I know, there is less and less time for me to swim in the pool of research world in my phD period, as free as I want to be.

Time is precious. I found I started to like research, I do not know if it is true or not, whatever, I should try it at my best with my full effort.
